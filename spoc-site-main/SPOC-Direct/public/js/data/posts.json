It is like Pixars Inside Out but with phones with how immersive and emotional it is. Where it lacks in some visual departments it more than makes up with it in its up to date humor and outstanding character design which puts it leagues most animated films made in the last 10 years! Which is why i suggest that if we do movie night that it is to watch Bee Movie, directors cut.",
